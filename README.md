### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Bamidele Oluwatobi

I am a software developer from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬, I basically write Javascript for now, but that could change any moment as I am looking forward to learning other programming languages.

- I build frontend applications using ReactJS and Backend using NodeJs.

- I am currently in love with Bitcoin and Lightning, learning about Bitcoin/Lightning and also building applications that help users use Bitcoin/Lightning effectively.

- [Also write about Bitcoin here, check it out](https://medium.com/@teebams49)
